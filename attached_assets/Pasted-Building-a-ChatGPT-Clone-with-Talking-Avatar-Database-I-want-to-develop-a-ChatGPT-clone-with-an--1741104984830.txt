Building a ChatGPT Clone with Talking Avatar & Database

"I want to develop a ChatGPT clone with an additional feature: a talking avatar that interacts with users via voice. The system should be able to process text inputs and respond in natural speech, while also integrating a database to store user interactions, preferences, and history. The final project should be deployable on GitHub and easily maintainable."
🔹 Core Features:

✅ ChatGPT-Like Conversational AI – The system should handle natural conversations similar to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
✅ Talking Avatar – A visual avatar that moves its lips and speaks while responding to users (text-to-speech & animation).
✅ Voice Input & Output – Users should be able to talk to the chatbot using their voice, and the bot should respond with voice as well.
✅ Database Integration – Store user interactions, chat history, and preferences.
✅ GitHub Deployment – Codebase should be structured for easy deployment via GitHub.
🔹 Technical Requirements:
1️⃣ Frontend (User Interface & Avatar)

    Framework: React.js (preferred) or Next.js
    Avatar Animation: Use Three.js, TensorFlow.js, or MediaPipe for lip-syncing animations.
    Speech Recognition: Use Web Speech API or Deepgram API for voice input.
    Text-to-Speech (TTS): Implement Google Text-to-Speech (TTS), ElevenLabs, or OpenAI TTS API to make the avatar talk.

2️⃣ Backend (AI Processing & Database)

    Framework: Flask (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
    Chatbot Model: Use OpenAI API (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5) for responses.
    Voice Processing: Convert user speech to text and text responses to speech.
    Database:
        MongoDB (NoSQL) for chat history & user profiles
        PostgreSQL (SQL) if structured data is preferred
    Authentication (Optional): Add user login/signup for saving personalized chat data.

3️⃣ Hosting & Deployment

    GitHub Repository: Upload full project with structured documentation.
    Backend Hosting: Deploy API on AWS, Google Cloud, or Render.
    Frontend Hosting: Use Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting.
    CI/CD: Automate deployment using GitHub Actions.

🔹 Additional Features (Optional, If Feasible)

🔸 Multimodal AI – Allow the avatar to process both text & images as inputs.
🔸 Memory Feature – Store conversation history and allow the AI to remember past chats.
🔸 Personalized Voices – Let users choose different voice styles for responses.
🔸 Mobile-Friendly Design – Ensure the UI works smoothly on mobile devices.
🔹 Goal & Deliverables:

🚀 Goal: To create a ChatGPT clone with a talking avatar that responds via voice and stores user interactions in a database. The project should be fully deployable on GitHub with proper documentation.

Deliverables:
✅ A working web-based AI chatbot with a talking avatar
✅ Integrated voice input & text-to-speech output
✅ Database to store chat history
✅ GitHub repository with structured code and README
✅ Deployment instructions for hosting
