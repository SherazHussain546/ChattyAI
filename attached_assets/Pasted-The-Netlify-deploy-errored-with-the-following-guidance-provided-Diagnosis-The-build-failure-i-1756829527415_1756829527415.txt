The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is caused by the error:
- Error: Your publish directory does not contain expected Next.js build output. Please check your build settings on line [93](#L93).

### Solution
1. Update the build settings to ensure the publish directory contains the expected output from the Next.js build.
2. Double-check the Next.js build settings and make sure they are correctly configured to generate the build output in the designated publish directory.
3. Verify that the Next.js build completes successfully and that the necessary files are created in the publish directory.
4. If the issue persists, ensure that the relevant package or file is included in the project dependencies or committed to the repository.
