The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to an error related to an invalid input for the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin.

In line 59 of the logs, the error message indicates that the plugin does not accept the input "disable" that was specified in the configuration.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the input name is spelled correctly and is included in the plugin's available configuration options.
2. Since the input "disable" is not a valid configuration for the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin, it needs to be removed from the plugin configuration.

To fix this issue:
- Remove the "disable: true" configuration from the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin in the `netlify.toml` file.

After removing the invalid input, commit the changes and trigger another build to check if the issue is resolved.
