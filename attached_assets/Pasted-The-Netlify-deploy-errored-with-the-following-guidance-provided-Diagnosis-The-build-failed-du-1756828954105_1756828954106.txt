The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failed due to an error in the Netlify plugin "@netlify/plugin-nextjs" with the following details:
- Error message: "Your publish directory does not contain expected Next.js build output. Please check your build settings"
- Error location: In "onBuild" event in "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

### Solution
1. Verify that your Next.js project has been built successfully and the build output is located in the correct directory.
2. Ensure that the Next.js build output directory is correctly specified in your Netlify build settings.

If the build output directory is correct and the issue persists:
- Check the plugin configuration to ensure it is set up correctly for Next.js projects.
- Verify that the necessary Next.js build steps are being executed during the build process.

It seems there might be a misconfiguration or issue with the build output path or the plugin setup for Next.js. Double-checking these configurations should help resolve the error.
